List of github trending project based user query

I am using the treding url of https://github-trending-api.now.sh/repositories which was generated by @huchenme reference https://github.com/huchenme/github-trending-api

I was using Github API first: https://api.github.com/search/repositories?order=desc&sort=stars&q=swift&page=1, however, due to the limit access, it does not always return data. I decide to use the one above.

There are also some design decision based on wheather to create a cell type with .xib file and cellmodel or use the basic one. Due to the simplicity of this app, I think it is better to not over kill
