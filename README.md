# GitHubTrending

List of github trending project based user query

I am using the trending url of https://github-trending-api.now.sh/repositories which was generated by @huchenme reference https://github.com/huchenme/github-trending-api

I was using Github API first: https://api.github.com/search/repositories?order=desc&sort=stars&q=swift&page=1, however, due to the limit access, it does not always return data. I decide to use the one above.

In the main view controller, it lists trending projects, which can have three different types of tableviewCells: loadingTableViewCell, ErrorTableViewCell, and ProjectsTableViewCell. Since the first two was more generic, I used the nibloaded view, while the projectTableViewCell are more tight with mainview, so it was built in storyboard. As that said, even there three types of tableviewCell, the controller doesn't have to deal with this logic in render tableviewcell, its use the protocol of ConfigurableTableViewCell. and rending the config function

In detail view controller, I used the wkwebview to display the readme file. I use a scroller view to wrap the leading view and wkwebview, and disable wkwebview self scroller. When webview content size change, I update the wkwebview size, so the it will auto update the wrapper scroller content size. 

For networking, I did a more generic approach, it is easy to testing, and extending. In the future, if we have more networking requirement, we can use should DispatchGroup to manage that.
